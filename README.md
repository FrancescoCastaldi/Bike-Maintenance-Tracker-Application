\section*{Bike Maintenance Tracker Application}

\subsection*{Overview}

The Bike Maintenance Tracker is a command-line application designed to assist cycling enthusiasts in maintaining and managing their road bikes. This application allows users to add, view, and update maintenance records, track the weight of the bike, and monitor the wear levels of various components. By providing a structured and easy-to-use interface, it ensures that users can keep their bikes in optimal condition.

\subsection*{Features}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Maintenance Records Management:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Add new maintenance records with the date and a detailed description of the service performed.
        \item View a list of all maintenance records to keep track of past services.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Bike Weight Tracking:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Update and store the weight of the bike.
        \item View the current weight of the bike.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Component Wear Level Monitoring:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item View the wear levels of key bike components, including tires, inner tubes, derailleur cables, brake cables, and handlebar tape.
        \item Update the wear levels of each component to ensure timely replacements and maintenance.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Implementation Details}

The application is developed in C, leveraging standard input/output functions to interact with the user and file handling to persist data. The main components of the application include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Structures:} Use of structured data types (\texttt{struct}) to define maintenance records and bike components.
    \item \textbf{File Handling:} Efficient reading and writing to text files (\texttt{records.txt} and \texttt{components.txt}) to ensure data persistence across sessions.
    \item \textbf{User Interface:} A simple menu-driven interface that guides the user through various operations like adding records, updating weight, and viewing components.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Creation Process}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Requirements Gathering:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Identified the key features needed for effective bike maintenance management.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Design:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Structured the application into modular functions for adding, viewing, and updating records.
        \item Defined data structures for maintenance records and bike components.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Implementation:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Developed the core functionalities using C programming language.
        \item Implemented file operations to ensure data persistence, creating or updating files as necessary.
        \item Incorporated input validation and error handling to enhance user experience and application reliability.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Testing and Refinement:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Conducted thorough testing to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
        \item Refined the code to handle edge cases and improve performance.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Documentation:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Documented the code with comments for maintainability and provided user instructions for running the application.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

This structured approach ensured that the application not only meets user needs but is also robust and reliable, providing a valuable tool for bike maintenance enthusiasts.
